This project invovled recreating a landing page with some css designs. 
The landing page displays an item sourced from america available for purchase through Amazon,com, 
and the page provides the product informatoin along with a link to take the user back 
to amazon.com so they can verify all of the product information and 
complete the purchase using the buttins at hte bottom of the landing page on the website.
Recreating the website took 45 minutes, as a beginner I believe this was done in good timing because 
it allowed me to use attention to detail in teh recreation and have formatting be 100% idenetical
